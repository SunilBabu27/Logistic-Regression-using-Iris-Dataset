# Logistic-Regression-using-Iris-Dataset
This segment of code illustrates the usage of logistic regression for classification<br>
<br>1. First, load the Iris Dataset, which contains the data(data to learn), target(classification labels), target_names(meaning of the labels), feature_names(meaning of the features) and DESCR(full description of the dataset).<br>
<br>2. Once loaded, we explore the dataset to analyze its dimensionality, classes and features.<br>
<br>3. Then, plot the dataset using matplotlib to visualize the dataset.<br>
<br>4. Create an instance of the Logistic Regression classsifier<br>
<br>5. Now, train the model and evaluate preformance using cross-validation<br>
<br>6. Plot the decision surface of the classifier to visualize the decision boundary using color maps.<br>
<br>7. Now, regularize the logistic regression by standardizing data features of the dataset.<br>
<br>8. Set the initial regularization parameter and train the model to get the coefficients of the model.<br>
<br>9. Display the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels and plot the final results.<br>
